O proprio exerc√≠cio 02 trabalha muito bem essa parte 

~~~ C
#include<iostream>

int main(void)
{
	std::string string =  "HI THIS IS BRAIN";
	std::string *stringPTR = &string;
	std::string &stringREF = string;

	std::cout << "The memory address of the string variable:" << &string << std::endl;
	std::cout << "The memory address held by stringPTR:" << stringPTR << std::endl;
	std::cout << "The memory address held by stringREF:" << &stringREF << std::endl;
	
	std::cout << "The value of the string variable:" << string << std::endl;
	std::cout << "The value pointed to by stringPTR:" << *stringPTR << std::endl;
	std::cout << "The value pointed to by stringREF:" << stringREF << std::endl;
}
